## FAQ

<details>
  <summary>Q: Why not Typescript?</summary>
  In this prototyping phase I chose speed of developement at the expense not solving every edge cases.
  Once the exploration of how to implement the feature with which tools is done, I plan to refactor the code to Typescript.

  <summary>Q: Why Vue/Nuxt?</summary>
  I just wanted to play around with a framework that looks apealing to me. 
  I'm not pretending it's the best tool for the job. Some simple HTML/CSS with some fancy JS might do the trick too.

  <summary>Q: Why Tailwind?</summary>
  Also because I just wanted to play around with itâ€¦
  Some crafted CSS would be cleaner but it's not a high priority for this personal tool.
